To test 3D stencil exchanges,

mpiexec -n 64 ./stencil

<<RMA code not yet implemented >>
After running stencil, check the performance of the RMA runs: NR-D and NR-U
On some implementations of MPI, RMA performance, particularly with derived
datatypes, is extremely poor.  If the performance for NR-D is poor, add
--normadtype to the arguments.  If the performance for NR-U is poor, add
--normacontig to the arguments.  If both are poor, use --norma .  For example,

mpiexec -n 4096 ./stencil --normadtype

The program stencil runs several different approaches to communication.  These
are noted in the second column.  These are:

  <Blocking | Nonblocking> <Point2point | RMA | Sharedmemory | Collective-sparse>
     <? Overlap> <Userdata-packing | Datatype> [ <? Persistent-request> ]

By default, the tests are run on MPI_COMM_WORLD and on communicators that
are not congurent (have the same group members and ordering). By adding
the argument --noskip , the tests will include these communicators.
To run the tests with the sparse collectives, even if the communicator
created by MPI_Cart_create is congruent to MPI_COMM_WORLD, add --withcart:

    mpiexec -n 4096 ./stencil --normadtype --withcart

Message sizes can be specified with --size range, as in


    mpiexec -n 4096 ./stencil --size 16,32,64 --normadtype --withcart

(this list of sizes is the default).

Finally, the output from stencil goes to stdout by default.  Use -o filename
to output to a file (name s4k.txt in this case):

    mpiexec -n 4096 ./stencil --normadtype --withcart -o s4k.txt
