<H2>Notes</H2>
When benchmarking codes on SMP nodes, it is common to run the benchmark
on a single core. However, in many applications, this is not the configuration
that is important for the application.  It is common for the application to
be running the same (or similar) code on all cores at the same time.
The <tt>MPUTIL_XXX</tt> macros provide a relatively easy way to run the same,
single-core benchmark on 1, 2, 3, ..., k cores for a node with k total cores.
Additional macros makes it easy to generate simple tables where there is
a separate column for each number of active cores for the benchmark.
See <tt>MPUTIL_LABEL</tt> and <tt>MPUTIL_OUTAPP</tt> for output.
<P>
A typical program that uses these macros will have the following structure:
<PRE>
   ...
   MPUTIL_INIT(0);
   ...any code that is executed only once, independent of the number of cores
   MPUTIL_BEGIN;
   ...any code that each active core must execute, such as initialization
   MPUTIL_LABEL("label text for row, in printf format");
   MPUTIL_SYNC;
   ... benchmark code, including timer calls.  Total time in tval
   MPUTIL_OUTAPP("\t%.2e\n",tval);
   MPUTIL_END;
   MPUTIL_FINALIZE;
</PRE>

<P>
The <tt>thread_level</tt> is used only when creating the parallel version, which
uses MPI processes to execute the benchmark in parallel.  To simplify the
interface, this does not use the MPI-defined levels (thus, the benchmark
never need inlude mpi.h).  The valid values are <tt>0</tt> for no threads used
(<tt>MPI_THREAD_SINGLE</tt>), <tt>1</tt> for threads used in loops (<tt>MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED</tt>),
and <tt>2</tt> for benchmarks that need <tt>MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE</tt>.  Most regular
benchmarks will use <tt>0</tt>, but OpenMP benchmarks will need to set
<tt>thread_level</tt> to <tt>1</tt>.
