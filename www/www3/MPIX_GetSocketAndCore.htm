Get the socket and Core on which the calling process was running 
<H2>Synopsis</H2>
<PRE>
int MPIX_GetSocketAndCPU(int *nsocket, int *socketrank, int *rankinsocket)
</PRE>
<H2>Output Parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>nsocket </B><DD>Number of sockets on the node

<DT><B>socketrank </B><DD>Rank of the socket on which the process is running

<DT><B>rankinsocket </B><DD>Rank of the core in the socket on which the process is
running
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Return Value</H2>
<tt>0</tt> on success and <tt>-1</tt> on failure
<P>
<H2>Notes</H2>
The values returned reflect the socket and core that was running the calling
process at some time.  The runtime system or operating system may move the
process to another core or socket. The <tt>rankinsocket</tt> may not be
consecutive; for example, on a Cray XE6, these might be only even values,
since it is common to allocate processes to core-modules, which consist of
a pair of cores.
