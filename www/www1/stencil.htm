Measure the performance of different halo-exchange approaches in MPI for a regular stencil code 
<H2>Input Parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT><B>nrange </B><DD>Range of problem sizes.  See below

<DT><B>energy </B><DD>Amount of energy to input into the simulation

<DT><B>niters </B><DD>Number of iterations to perform

<DT><B>px </B><DD>Number of processes in the x-direction

<DT><B>py </B><DD>Number of processes in the y-direction

<DT><B>filename </B><DD>Name of output file (stdout if not provided)
</DL>
<P>
<H2>Output Results</H2>
The output is printed as a tab-separated table, indicating the
time for the different operations and halo-exchange choices, as well as an
achieved computation rate.  The default output is to stdout, but can be
changed with a commandline argument.
<P>
<H2>Notes</H2>
The <tt>nrange</tt> parameter provides the size of a size of the mesh, and may
be either a single value, a comma-separated list, or a range in the form
<tt>start:end:increment</tt>.
<P>
The program should be compiled with optimization and with vectorization
enabled if the computation rates are to be used.  Note that the computation
code does not compute the heat per iteration unless the code is compiled
with <tt>-DCOMPUTE_HEAT_EACH_ITERATION=1</tt>.  Including this code causes the
Cray compiler (at least) to fail to vectorize the application of the stencil
in the same loop, causing a significant loss in performance.
