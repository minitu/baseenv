Installation notes

Configuration Step
==================
For the most common use, just do

./configure

If the MPI compilation scripts are not mpicc or mpicc, or they are not
in the path, provide them using MPICC and MPIFORT, as in

./configure MPICC=mpxlc MPIFORT=mpxlf

If the C compiler can be used for both C and MPI programs, as is the
case for the Cray XE6/XK7, use

./configure CC=cc FC=fort

By default, this package builds only some of the components.  Use the
appropriate "with" arguments to control which components are built.
For example, to build fpmpi2, add --with-fpmpi2

Some of the I/O tests need to know a directory in the high performance
(hopefully parallel) file system.  Use the variable MYSCRATCHDIR to
set this (by default, this is set to the current directory, "."), as in

./configure MYSCRATCHDIR=/u/fast/me/testdir

Specific Systems:

UIUC Blue Waters:
The choice of compilers will depend on what modules you have loaded.
With the default setup, the following may work:

./configure CC=cc FC=ftn COPT=-O3 FCOPT=-O3

ANL Theta (Intel KNL)

./configure --host=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu MPICC=cc MPIFORT=ftn

Build Step
==========
A simple

   make

is sufficient to build the package.  However, two important options are the
COMPILER_FAMILY and COMPILER_ARCH.  COMPILER_FAMILY is the compiler that
is used; known compilers include gcc, clang, cray, intel, pgi, and xlc.
COMPILER_ARCH is the system architecture as needed by the compiler.  For
example, for Blue Waters,

   make COMPILER_FAMILY=cray COMPILER_ARCH=xe6

For Blue Gene/Q

   make COMPILER_FAMILY=xlc COMPILER_ARCH=bgq

These options enable vectorization of the compute-intensive benchmarks and
examples.
