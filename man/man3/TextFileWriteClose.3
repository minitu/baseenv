.SH NOTES
In the case where the 
.I TextFile
was opened from an existing file handle,
this routine does 
.B not
close the file associated with the handle.  However,
this routine should still be called to ensure that any other operations
needed to close the 
.I TextFile
are completed.

.SH RETURN VALUE
An error code.  Currently, 
.I MPI_SUCCESS
is returned on success and an
MPI error class is returned on failure.  A future implementation may
return a user-defined MPI error code.
