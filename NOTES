Notes on this group of packages.

This package provides a basic environment for parallel programming in an
MPI environment.  The intent is to have relatively small, separable packages,
but setup to permit a combined build and a single library containing all
selected components.  To make this work, all of the component packages
must follow the same rules for configure options, and for error reporting
and naming.  These rules are detailed here.

Error Reporting
No error is 0.
Unspecified error is -1
Error in errno is -2
Positive values are specific errors, and the package should provide a
routine to convert these values into a string.
