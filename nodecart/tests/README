Test and Demonstration programs for nodecart

Performance Demonstrations
ncartperf - This is a program that can be used to explore the performance
            benefits of using the nodecart approach for MPI_Cart_create

Test Programs
hdecomp - Test of a 2-level decomposition
layout  - Create a file with the mapping of processes
ncarttest - Test of the ncart routines

Test of MPI_Cart_create replacement
shimtest  - C version.  Tests to see if the shims properly intercept calls
            to MPI_Cart_create and friends
shimtestf - Fortran version


Interpreting the tests
hdecomp - This program tests some of the internal routines in nodecart. The
          output must be manually examined.  This routine is only useful
          when debugging those internal routines (decompDims and rankToCoords)
layout -  Writes out the mapping of processes of mapping.txt, giving the rank in
          MPI_COMM_WORLD (wrank), the rank of the node on which the process is
	  running (nrank) and number of processes on that node (nsize),
	  the rank on the node (ronnode), the rank of the chip on the node
	  (rchip) and the rank of the process on the chip (ronchip).  The
	  chip information is only available on some systems as it requires
	  additional, non-portable information. In correct operation, three
	  Layouts are generated: MPI_COMM_WORLD, ncart (in the rank order of
	  MPI_COMM_WORLD), and ncart (in the rank order of ncart).
ncarttest - Prints out information about the nodes, creates a Cartesian
	  communicator, and prints the neighbors (by rank) in the Cartesian
	  directions.  The output of this program must be examined by hand.

shimtest - Both print "Test PASSED" on success.
